Coming atcha with my submission for the Epicurrence x Dribbble x Yosemite Conservancy challenge!

:sunrise_over_mountains: :sunrise_over_mountains: :sunrise_over_mountains:

**The Yosemite Conservancy**  is a non-profit organization that funds trail and habitat restoration projects, wildlife-protection programs, scientific research and more to preserve and protect Yosemite’s natural wonders.

At Winter Work Week, attendees were challenged to give the company a full redesign, from branding to video to marketing materials to apps to a new landing page.

I took on the landing page challenge, because I was interested in the UX patterns behind converting visitors to make donations, which is the primary goal of the site.

The trick to triggering donations is to capture the right combination of significance and urgency, all while making the donors the hero in the story by making a donation.

**In the case of Yosemite, there's an easy angle to take–**

:one: Of all the parks in the country, Yosemite has some of the richest history.

:two: Our national parks are at greater risk now than ever before.

**So I built my design direction around the following–**

:one: The park's storied history.  
:small_orange_diamond: images of Ansel Adams and John Muir  
:small_orange_diamond: copy focusing on protecting the park's history for the benefit of future generations

:two: Earthy, nostalgic design elements.  
:small_orange_diamond: a retro, earthy color palette, including the rusty greens and oranges we associate with the parks service  
:small_orange_diamond: timeless typography  
:small_orange_diamond: a clean and simple layout so the style doesn't overwhelm
